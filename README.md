# 👾 I MONSTER BOT 👾

Welcome to **I Monster Bot** — a thrilling game of deception and deduction where players must figure out who the imposter is! 🎮🕵️‍♂️

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

1. **Each player** is assigned a secret word by the bot operator, **except one** (the imposter 👀).
2. Players take turns speaking about the given word, trying not to give themselves away.
3. The imposter, who doesn’t know the word, must pretend to fit in! 🤔
4. **Players can call for a vote** to find the imposter after the first round. 🗳️
5. If the imposter is voted out, they lose. But if the imposter survives, they win! 🎉
